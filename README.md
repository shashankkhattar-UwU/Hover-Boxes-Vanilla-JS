# Hover-Boxes-Vanilla-JS
<h2>CSA Front End Round 2</h2>

This project uses Javascript to display details stored about particualr images once the viewer hovers the mouse over the image.\n
The divs are fabricated and rendered when mouse is hovered over the image, and is removed when the mouse leaves the image.\n
The images are also rendered using javascript, which reads from a 'data' variable in it and produces a list of unique articles with it's respective image and then renders it inside the mainDiv.\n
For adding more images with their description we only need to add another object in the data array in index.js file and will automatically be rendered inside the mainDiv.\n
The webpage uses flex and thus is responsive, so it works on all resolutions.\n
